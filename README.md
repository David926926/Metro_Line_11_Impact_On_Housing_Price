This project analyzes how the opening of Suzhou Metro Line 11 influenced second-hand housing prices in Kunshan. Using 11,154 transaction records from 2022–2024, we classify properties into spatial distance bands and estimate a causal model that incorporates pre-/post-construction interaction terms inspired by a Difference-in-Differences framework. The regression uses an OLS specification with robust standard errors and controls for property characteristics such as area, bedroom count, age, orientation, floor level, and decoration quality. Results show that while housing closer to stations generally maintained stronger prices, broader post-COVID market declines offset much of the metro’s expected positive impact. The study highlights the importance of combining spatial heterogeneity with temporal variation when evaluating transportation infrastructure effects.
